EPUB Preparer lets you open an EPUB file, edit its title and author metadata, optionally strip Project Gutenberg boilerplate text, and download the corrected file — all in the browser with no server or install required.

Drop an EPUB onto the page or click to choose a file. You can also fetch an EPUB directly from a URL, though note that most sites (including Project Gutenberg) block direct browser fetches due to CORS restrictions — for Gutenberg files, download the EPUB from the book's page first, then drop it here. Once loaded, a read-only bar shows the original title and author exactly as found in the file. The editable fields below are pre-populated from that same metadata. The "Clean Gutenberg Title" button parses titles like "Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen" and splits them into separate fields. "Strip Boilerplate" removes the "Produced by..." credit block that appears at the top of most Gutenberg files.

After clicking Download, the tool re-reads the saved file and shows a three-column comparison table: the original values from the file, what you edited them to, and what was verified in the downloaded file. Changed fields are highlighted with an arrow. If anything didn't round-trip correctly a warning is shown so you can investigate before using the file.
