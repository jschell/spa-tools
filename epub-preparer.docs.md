EPUB Preparer lets you open an EPUB file, edit its title and author metadata, optionally strip Project Gutenberg boilerplate text, and download the corrected file — all in the browser with no server or install required.

Drop an EPUB onto the page or click to choose a file. You can also paste a Project Gutenberg book-page URL (e.g. `https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342`) and the tool will resolve it to the direct EPUB download automatically. Once loaded, the title and author fields are pre-populated from the file's metadata. The "Clean Gutenberg Title" button parses titles like "Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen" and splits them into separate fields. "Strip Boilerplate" removes the "Produced by..." credit block that appears at the top of most Gutenberg files. The suggested download filename updates in real time as you edit the fields.

The drop zone also includes a bookmarklet — drag the "Prepare in Tool" button to your browser's bookmarks bar. After that, whenever you are on a Project Gutenberg book page (e.g. `gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342`), clicking the bookmarklet fetches the EPUB from within Gutenberg's own origin (bypassing CORS) and sends it directly to a new tab running this tool, ready to edit.
