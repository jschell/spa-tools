EPUB Preparer lets you open an EPUB file, edit its title and author metadata, optionally strip Project Gutenberg boilerplate text, and download the corrected file — all in the browser with no server or install required.

Drop an EPUB onto the page or click to choose a file. You can also fetch an EPUB directly from a URL, though note that most sites (including Project Gutenberg) block direct browser fetches due to CORS restrictions — for Gutenberg files, download the EPUB from the book's page first, then drop it here. Once loaded, the title and author fields are pre-populated from the file's metadata. The "Clean Gutenberg Title" button parses titles like "Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen" and splits them into separate fields. "Strip Boilerplate" removes the "Produced by..." credit block that appears at the top of most Gutenberg files.

After clicking Download, the tool re-reads the saved file and confirms the metadata was written correctly, showing the verified title and author. If anything doesn't match what you entered, a warning is shown so you can investigate before using the file.
