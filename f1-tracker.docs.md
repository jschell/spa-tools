F1 Tracker is a single-page dashboard for Formula 1 fans. It shows a live countdown to the next session (updated every second), a 7-day weather forecast for the race circuit, the current driver and constructor standings, the full season calendar with per-race session times, and the latest F1 news from six sources — all without any login, account, or configuration.

Race schedule and standings data come from the Jolpica API (a community-maintained successor to the Ergast F1 API). Weather forecasts use Open-Meteo, a free API that requires no key. News is fetched from six RSS feeds (Formula 1, BBC Sport, Autosport, Motorsport.com, RacingNews365, RACER) via rss2json.com, a free service that handles the cross-origin request on the server side — no proxy setup required. If rss2json.com is unavailable, the tool falls back to a cached copy of recent headlines stored in `news-cache.json`, which is refreshed automatically every 30 minutes by a GitHub Actions workflow.

Settings including preferred temperature unit, theme, refresh interval, and which news feeds to show are saved in the browser's local storage and persist across sessions.
