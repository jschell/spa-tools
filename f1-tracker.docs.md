F1 Tracker is a single-page dashboard for Formula 1 fans. It shows a live countdown to the next session (updated every second), a 7-day weather forecast for the race circuit, the current driver and constructor standings, the full season calendar with per-race session times, and the latest F1 news from up to six RSS feeds — all without any login or account.

Race schedule and standings data come from the Jolpica API (a community-maintained successor to the Ergast F1 API). Weather forecasts use Open-Meteo, a free API that requires no key. Both of these work immediately with no configuration. News feeds are sourced from Formula 1, BBC Sport, Autosport, Motorsport.com, RacingNews365, and RACER via RSS; because RSS feeds do not include CORS headers, a proxy is required to fetch them from the browser.

To enable news, open Settings (the gear icon in the top right) and paste a CORS proxy URL into the field at the bottom. Any HTTP proxy that forwards requests and adds an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` response header will work — a simple Cloudflare Worker is one option. Without a proxy URL, all other sections (countdown, weather, calendar, standings) continue to work normally. Settings including your proxy URL, preferred temperature unit, theme, and refresh interval are saved in the browser's local storage and persist across sessions.
